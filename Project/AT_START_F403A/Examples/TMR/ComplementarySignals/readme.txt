@par Example Description
 
  @Description
  This demo shows how to configure the TMR1 peripheral to generate three 
  complementary TMR1 signals, to insert a defined dead time value, to use the break 
  feature and to lock the desired parameters.
  
  TMR1 Configuration to:
  
      1/ Generate 3 complementary PWM signals with 3 different duty cycles:
        TIM1CLK is fixed to SystemCoreClock, the TMR1 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the 
        TMR1 counter clock used is SystemCoreClock.
        * SystemCoreClock is set to 240 MHz .

        The objective is to generate PWM signal at 17.57 KHz:
        - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1

        The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description: 

        The channel 1 duty cycle is set to 50% so channel 1N is set to 50%.
        The channel 2 duty cycle is set to 25% so channel 2N is set to 75%.
        The channel 3 duty cycle is set to 12.5% so channel 3N is set to 87.5%.
        The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
          - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

      2/ Insert a dead time equal to 11/SystemCoreClock ns
      3/ Configure the break feature, active at High level, and using the automatic 
         output enable feature
      4/ Use the Locking parameters level1. 
      
  The TMR1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.
  
  Set-up 
    - Connect the TMR1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TMR1_CH1  pin (PA.08)  
      - TMR1_CH1N pin (PB.13)  
      - TMR1_CH2  pin (PA.09)  
      - TMR1_CH2N pin (PB.14)  
      - TMR1_CH3  pin (PA.10)  
      - TMR1_CH3N pin (PB.15)

    - Connect the TMR1 break pin TMR1_BKIN pin (PB.12) to the GND. To generate a 
      break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V.

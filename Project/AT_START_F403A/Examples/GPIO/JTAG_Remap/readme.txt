  * @Description
  * 
  *   This example provides a short description of how to use the JTAG/SWD IOs
  * as standard GPIOs and gives a configuration sequence. 
  *   First, the SWJ-DP is enabled, five SWD-DP pins are not toggled. If the 
  * PB2 is pressed the SWJ-DP will be disabled. The SWJ-DP pins are configured
  * as output push-pull. The PA.13(JTMS/SWDAT), PA.14(JTCK/SWCLK), PA.15(JTDI),
  * PB.03(JTDO) and PB.04(JTRST) pins are toggled in an infinite loop.
